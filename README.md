Sabanci University - DSA210 - Fall 2026 Term Project

Introduction
---
Do people who live in coastal towns live a happier life?
With this project, my aim is to gather information about the average well-being of people living in different cities of Turkey and correlate this information with the cities they live in and specifically whether they have easy access to the sea. I plan to enrich this analysis by also considering and controlling socio-economic factors like average income and unemployment rate, and environmental factors like air quality. 

Motivation
---
People living in coastal towns often argue they couldn't ever live far from the sea. But people living in non-coastal towns often argue that living in a coastal or not does not really affect the general well-being of a person. In order to shed light on the discussion, this project aims to analyze the correlation between general well-being and proximity to open waters.

Data Sources
